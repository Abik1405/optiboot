Easy DIY Avr (Arduino) Boards
================================================================================

### :star: You probably want to just go straight to [dists/README.md](dists/README.md) :star:

This is a "fork" of optiboot (http://github.com/Optiboot/optiboot) in which I have cleaned up the build and distribution process to create an easy to install setup which covers a wide range of Atmel AVR Microcontrollers.

## Usage

See [dists/README.md](dists/README.md) for the installation and usage instructions for your specific Arduino IDE Version.

## Developers

If you want to add support for more chips, start here: [DEVELOPERS.md](DEVELOPERS.md)
