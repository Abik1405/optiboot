Easy DIY Avr (Arduino) Boards
================================================================================

This is a "fork" of optiboot (http://github.com/Optiboot/optiboot) in which I have cleaned up the build and distribution process to create an easy to install setup which covers a wide range of Atmel AVR Microcontrollers.
